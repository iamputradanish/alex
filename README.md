Alex is our CG2271 mini project robot for NUS. 
It is capable of being remotely controlled with a smartphone application via BlueTooth connection.
It used FreeRTOS on the Arduino Uno to control multiple tasks at the same time.

The files we used for the demo are "RTOS mode/AlexRTOS_v1.0.cpp" and "RTOS mode/BT06_backup.aia".
